React + Vite (TypeScript)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React with TypeScript working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react
 uses Babel
 for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
 uses SWC
 for Fast Refresh

Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend enabling type-aware lint rules using typescript-eslint
. This ensures your TypeScript code is properly checked for type errors alongside standard linting rules.

Check out the React + TS template
 for more information on integrating TypeScript and ESLint into your project.
